Given Problem:
- 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall
- bar of a fixed length
- 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground
- linear actuator (picked from an online catalog, use max force values only)


Objectives:
- Design has 2 DOF (rigid body in 2D space)
- Design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest
possible height (assuming linear actuator and bar are rigid)


My Plan:
- Find dimensions of linear actuator needed (and overall specifications)
- Analyze bar at ground and at max height
- Find distance from pinned bar to base of actuator
- Find length l of bar and subsections l0 and l1 of bar
- Find max load


Solution:
Based on space limitations, I chose the IMA33 linear actuator as it was a good
balance between dimension and force. This gave a base height, hb, of 154 mm 
plus a stroke length of 152 mm for a maximum extension of 458 mm. This left 42 mm 
of heigh left for the 500 mm design space, which went into making the bar longer
to allow for extra weight. 


I then set up a system of equations for l, l1, and l0, knowing that l = 1500 mm.
Just using geometry I was able to solve for l0 = 125.45 mm and l1 = 1374.56 mm.
Through trigonometry I found that the distance between the actuator and the bar 
was 1295.93 mm.


With these geometric paraters in line, I was able to solve for the maximum weight 
the actuator could hold. I let Fin = 1446 N since it was the max force of the 
actuator, and assumed that the Fin was always perpendicular to the bar. With the
angle of elevation calculated to be 19.47 degrees, I split Fin into x and y 
components. Isolating just the bar and doing moment equilibrium about the end 
pin led me to find that the maximum load the actuator could life was 1404.7 N.

Part 2 of the homework:

I solved for the reaction pin in terms of the distributed weight w and then 
found internal shear and moment equations in terms of w. Knowing that moment 
diagrams must come back to zero at the end I solved for when M = 0 and found
that that the distributed weight was 1022 N/m. Then I found the maximum 
moment was 413 N-m from this. 

Next, I found maximum deflection in terms of moment of inertia, I, using the 
yield stress of structural steel (my chosen material). For part b, I used that
the maximum deflection was .3 mm to get a moment of inertia value of .4E6 mm^4.

I also found the S value to be 2E3 mm^3. Thus, the closest geometry was C150x19.3.
