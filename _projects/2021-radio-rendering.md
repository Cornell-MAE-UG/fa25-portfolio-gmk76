For a homework assignment,we were given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (our choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground, and a linear actuator. The linear actuator could be chosen from an online catalog, using max force values only. We were insttructed to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height, assuming all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.
